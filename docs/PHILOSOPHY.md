## The Name

**Diophantine** honors **Διόφαντος ὁ Ἀλεξανδρεύς** (Diophantus of Alexandria), the Greek mathematician who lived in Roman Egypt during the 3rd century CE. Known as the "father of algebra," Diophantus pioneered the study of equations with integer solutions—problems that demand exactness, elegance, and the recognition that some truths emerge only through patient deduction.

His seminal work, the *Arithmetica*, contained problems that challenged mathematicians for millennia. Pierre de Fermat's famous "Last Theorem" was scribbled in the margin of his copy of *Arithmetica*—a note that remained unproven for 358 years. This spirit of enduring inquiry, of problems worth solving, is the soul of this project.

Just as Diophantus sought integer solutions to complex equations, this tool seeks **exact solutions to the problem of digital privacy**: no approximations, no compromises, only mathematically sound encryption.

## Core Beliefs

### Encryption Is Not Secrecy

Encryption is not secrecy.

It is **structure applied to uncertainty**.

In the classical tradition, knowledge was meant to be preserved and transmitted—not hidden from worthiness, but protected from corruption. The ancient libraries of Alexandria did not burn because knowledge was weak; they burned because structure failed. Diophantine exists to ensure that your digital knowledge survives with its structure intact.

### The Three Pillars

Diophantine exists to give users:

| Pillar | Greek | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Control** | αὐτονομία (autonomia) | Self-governance; the law of oneself |
| **Clarity** | σαφήνεια (sapheneia) | Clearness; freedom from obscurity |
| **Ownership** | κυριότης (kyriotēs) | Dominion; rightful authority over one's possessions |

## Design Philosophy

### The Via Negativa

What Diophantine is **not**:

- **No cloud** — Your data does not belong on servers you do not control
- **No accounts** — You are not a user; you are a sovereign individual
- **No telemetry** — Your actions are not metrics for optimization
- **No obfuscation** — Security through transparency, not obscurity
- **No complexity for its own sake** — Elegance through simplicity

This is the **via negativa**: improvement by subtraction. Each feature not added is a potential vulnerability avoided. Each service not integrated is a dependency rejected.

### The Alexandrian Principle

The ancient Library of Alexandria operated under a principle: **knowledge should be collected, preserved, and made accessible to those who seek it**. Diophantine follows this principle:

1. **Collection** — Your data is yours to gather
2. **Preservation** — Encryption ensures it endures
3. **Access** — Only you hold the keys

## The Greek Spirit

### Etymology of Security

The ancient Greeks understood that true security comes from within:

| Greek | Transliteration | Meaning | Relevance |
|-------|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| **κρύπτω** | kryptō | to hide, to conceal | The root of "cryptography"—hiding in plain sight |
| **μέτρον** | metron | measure, balance | Encryption must be measured; too little is weakness, too much is burden |
| **λόγος** | logos | word, reason, principle | Meaning emerges from structure; data without context is noise |
| **ἀλήθεια** | aletheia | truth, disclosure | Encryption protects truth by controlling disclosure |
| **τέχνη** | technē | art, craft, skill | Security is a craft to be mastered, not a product to be bought |

### The Delphic Maxim

**"Γνῶθι σεαυτόν"** — *Know thyself.*

Before encrypting, ask:
- What am I protecting?
- From whom am I protecting it?
- What is the cost of loss?
- What is the cost of protection?

Self-knowledge precedes effective security.

## Mathematical Purity

### Integer Solutions

Diophantus studied equations where **only integer solutions were acceptable**. A fractional answer was no answer at all. This purity of requirement mirrors our approach:

- **No partial encryption** — Data is encrypted or it is not
- **No almost-private** — Access is granted or denied
- **No somewhat-secure** — Security is binary; a chain is only as strong as its weakest link

### The Fermat Margin

Fermat's famous margin note in *Arithmetica* read: *"I have discovered a truly marvelous proof, which this margin is too narrow to contain."*

We embrace the opposite principle: **If the margin is too narrow, the proof is not complete.** Simplicity and clarity are features. If security cannot be explained, it cannot be trusted.

## The Stoic Influence

Diophantine draws from Stoic philosophy, particularly the teachings of **Epictetus** and **Marcus Aurelius**:

### Dichotomy of Control

> *"Some things are within our power, while others are not."* — Epictetus

**Within your control:**
- The strength of your passwords
- The encryption of your files
- The security of your devices

**Not within your control:**
- Cloud provider breaches
- Government surveillance programs
- Malware infections on compromised systems

Focus effort where it matters.

### The Inner Citadel

Marcus Aurelius wrote of the **inner citadel**—the mind as a fortress that cannot be breached without consent. Encryption is the digital extension of this citadel:

> *"You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."*

## Practical Wisdom (Φρόνησις)

Theory without practice is empty. Practice without theory is blind.

### Daily Practice

1. **Encrypt before storing** — Never trust cloud storage with plaintext
2. **Verify before trusting** — Always test that encrypted files can be decrypted
3. **Delete after encrypting** — Remove plaintext after successful encryption
4. **Backup redundantly** — Multiple copies in multiple locations
5. **Review periodically** — Security is a practice, not a destination

### The Art of Enough

Diophantus did not seek to solve all equations—only those with elegant solutions. Similarly, Diophantine does not seek to protect against all threats—only those where protection is meaningful:

| Worth Protecting Against | Not a Design Goal |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Casual inspection | Nation-state actors |
| Lost/stolen devices | Physical coercion |
| Cloud provider access | Compromised OS |
| Network interception | Zero-day exploits |

Know the limits of your citadel.

## The Human Element

### Technology as Tool, Not Master

The Greeks distinguished between **τέχνη** (technē) — craft or skill — and **ἐπιστήμη** (epistēmē) — theoretical knowledge. Diophantine is technē: a tool to be wielded with skill, not a black box to be trusted blindly.

### Responsibility

With encryption comes responsibility:

- **Remember your passwords** — There is no backdoor, no recovery service
- **Verify your backups** — Encrypted data that cannot be decrypted is noise
- **Understand the limits** — Encryption protects data, not behavior

## Closing: The Alexandrian Legacy

The Library of Alexandria was destroyed, but the knowledge it preserved survived through copies, through scholars, through the enduring human drive to understand and to remember.

Your data is your knowledge. Your memories. Your work. Your legacy.

Diophantine ensures that this legacy remains **yours**—structured, protected, and accessible only to those you choose.
